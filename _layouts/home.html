		I'm an interactive and mobile designer for GitHub. Building things like Gaug.es, Speaker Deck, GitHub for Android, Gaug.es for Android, Play, as well as other fun and exciting projects. I love creating ways to make life easier through design and technology. I am a christian who knows I do not yet have the stamina of love that Jesus has; but hope that I can be known as one who tries to reach that standard. If I can help answer any questions or just to keep track of what we're building you can catch me on twitter at @michigangraham
