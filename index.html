      <p>We've been working hard on the latest updates for Gaug.es, and today we're excited to announce several updates. The first - welcoming Gaug.es to the Android market! All versions of Android from Froyo (Android 2.2) to Ice Cream Sandwich (Android 4.0) now have their own native app. The app gives you the same accessibility as the iPhone version, where you can get a quick look dashboard with all of your gauges, list views of your daily traffic, most viewed content, and top web referrers, and are able to watch visitors from all over the globe hit your websites as it happens with AirTraffic.</p>
