<p>Over a year ago my good buddy had asked me to join an amazing list of speakers to speak at <a href="https://twitter.com/frontendconf" target="_blank">@frontendconf</a> 2013 and after a nervous delay and lots of thought I accepted. I havenâ€™t been able to figure out how to say no to Dan, and for sure didnâ€™t want to let his gem of a wife Cherri down. I often times put a lot of pressure on myself, and never had been on the stage speaking (yes, this was also my first full public talk) I wanted to make sure I could give something for the audience to take home that would challenge their workflow and lives. This was that talk. <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/mattgraham/we-should-be-lovers">Slides on SpeakerDeck</a>.</p>

<p>My hope was to get people rethinking what it looked like to work (and live as youâ€™ll see) in community. Some of the things Iâ€™ve learned along the way and some of the things weâ€™ve stressed at GitHub. Once again, as I share this I hope you can learn that even in the rough spots you are in control of your thoughts and therefore emotions in life; we can and should work better together than we do apart.</p>
