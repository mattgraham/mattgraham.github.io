    In 2005, I convinced my college crush and dream girl Shannon to marry me. A decade and a half later after building careers and buying our home, our family grew with the laughter, warmth and the energy of our two precious daughters, Ella and Madisyn.

    When this is all said and done I hope its obvious my life was full of faith, hope and love, full of family, laughter, and community. My measure of success is love, devotion, and a steadfast commitment to making a meaningful impact in the world around me.
