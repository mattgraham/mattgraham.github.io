	<h1>$git remote rename orderedlist github</h1>
	<p>We are excited to announce that as of today the Ordred List team has been acquired and is joining forces with GitHub!</p>
	<p><img src="http://c.gr4m.com/image/1Q273q3B3x17/image" alt="" /></p>
	<p>We&#8217;ve been working hard to develop simple, sexy, web applications and we know it has not gone unnoticed. On the other side of the country we&#8217;ve watched a similar culture with a little more strength in numbers doing the same thing and the OL crew is very excited to be joining that team to continue to design and develop industry changing web applications.</p>
	<p>The OL crew and I are very excited to be joining the new team and looking forward to helping build what is already an amazing company.</p>
