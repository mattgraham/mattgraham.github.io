    <h1>Gaug.es Shipping Days</h1>
    <p>We&#8217;ve been working hard on the latest updates for Gaug.es, and today we&#8217;re excited to announce several updates. The first &#8211; welcoming Gaug.es to the Android market! All versions of Android from Froyo (Android 2.2) to Ice Cream Sandwich (Android 4.0) now have their own native app. The app gives you the same accessibility as the iPhone version, where you can get a quick look dashboard with all of your gauges, list views of your daily traffic, most viewed content, and top web referrers, and are able to watch visitors from all over the globe hit your websites as it happens with AirTraffic.</p>
    <p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/0j2o2e2T1s2q1g0B250s/Gauges_AndroidMarket.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>As a designer, my first challenge with this app was getting to know the Android OS. We worked hard to make it feel as native as possible while still bringing the simple, sexy gauges analytics to your phone. Another challenge was that we were designing for numerous devices and screen sizes. If you haven&#8217;t put this together yet, Gaug.es runs now on our 55&quot; Plasma screen TV&#8217;s at the GitHub office, showing off our analytics to the entire staff in real time. It&#8217;s a beautiful thing.</p>
    <p>Two other gents I want to thank for there crazy hard work are <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/rtyley" target="_blank">Roberto Tyley</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/kevinsawicki" target="_blank">Kevin Sawicki</a>. We sat in the GitHub executive room only a month and a half ago talking about Gaug.es for Android, and thanks to their hard work we made it happen.</p>
    <p>One additional exciting piece to the Android launch is that the app is being released as an open-source project under the Apache 2.0 license; the actual source to the app can be downloaded from GitHub <a href="https://github.com/github/gauges-android">here</a>.</p>
    <p>Gaug.es for Android is built on top of the awesome <a href="http://get.gaug.es/documentation/api/">Gaug.es <span class="caps">API</span></a> as well as several other great open source projects for Android development. Here are just a few:</p>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/JakeWharton/ActionBarSherlock">JakeWharton/ActionBarSherlock</a> &#8211; for a consistent, great looking header across all Android platforms.</p>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/JakeWharton/Android-ViewPagerIndicator">JakeWharton/Android-ViewPagerIndicator</a> &#8211; for being able to swipe between content, traffic and referrer pages.</p>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/JakeWharton/NineOldAndroids">JakeWharton/NineOldAndroids</a> &#8211; for the AirTraffic view animations.</p>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/jayway/maven-android-plugin">jayway/android-maven-plugin</a> &#8211; for building the app and running the integration and unit tests.</p>
    <h2>iOS Updates</h2>
    <p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/2k2Z1P1g1V0y3x2e0I1i/gauges_v2.png" style="float:right; margin-left: 20px;">We are also submitting several updates to the iTunes Store for Gaug.es for iPhone. The updates include several small bug fixes, security and performance additions and of course, exciting for me, an updated iOS icon to grow a little closer to the series of GitHub family iOS icons.</p>
    <p>There is always much going on behind the scenes at GitHub, and you can be sure we&#8217;re always looking for the next way to shock and awe the markets around us. If you didn&#8217;t catch the <a href="http://gr4m.com/AxQHpd">Wired Magazine</a> article about GitHub this past week, make sure to give it a quick read.</p></div>
