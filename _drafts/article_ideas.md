## Article Ideas

Often times I believe I have nothing to write about until sharing some bits of information with individuals leads to, "I didn't know you could do that." The goal of this list is to keep a tab of the things that I'd like to write about as I have time; then as time allows (and I force myself to be more consistent to thinking about it) I'll begin to write.

#### The list

- [ ] Automatic deployments are mandatory
- [ ] Streaming Audio for Anyone
- [ ] Why you should be using Atom.io now
- [ ] Hubot for ~~president~~ Productivity
- [ ] Fear Based Development (loosing a customer)
- [ ] Huggs & Kisses - Some families do, some dont... and won't.
- [ ] Into the Future (and we're still chasing the hoverboard).
