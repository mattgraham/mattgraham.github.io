### Guidelines for playing pranks on your friends without crossing the line.

I just returned home from a week long camping trip with our church and was met half way through with the understanding that the time has finally come to teach our youth group what it looks like to 'prank well'. But before I go through and outline my personal guidelines for what this looks like let me give you some background on myself.

For as long as I can remember I walked carefully on the edge of trouble and smiles. I've learned along the way that if you focus on the other persons heart it can be fun for all parties; this wasn't however always the case in my pre-frontal-lobe development.
