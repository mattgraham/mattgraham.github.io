	<h1>Gaug.es is Growing</h1>
	<p>Many were worried that with the acquisition to GitHub our products would be lost in the shuffle. We&#8217;re hoping you&#8217;ve been watching the last month of updates, and that this helps you rest easier; we&#8217;re only growing stronger. Today we&#8217;ve released both <strong>Daily Email Summaries</strong> and <strong>Browser Support Statistics</strong>, and we think they&#8217;ll blow your mind.</p>
	<h2>Daily Email Summaries</h2>

	<p>This is my favorite addition, because for those who have the self-control not to leave Gaug.es up in a window all day long (I&#8217;m not among these), you can have daily email summaries sent to you so you&#8217;re able to quickly track your stats. I know it sounds crazy, but some out there do not watch their statistics on their iPad while working (not that I know people that do, cough).</p>
	<h2>Browser Support</h2>

	<p>Browser Support gives you exactly what you need to find out what percentage of <span class="caps">CSS</span>, HTML5, and Javascript features your visitor&#8217;s browsers support.</p>
	<p>For the official GitHub blog post <a href="https://github.com/blog/1019-gauges-daily-summaries-and-browser-support" target="_blank">click here.</a> and if you don&#8217;t have a Gaug.es account? Holy smokes, <a href="http://get.gaug.es" target="_blank">get one now!</a></p></div>
