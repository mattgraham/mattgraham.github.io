	<h1>Gaug.es for iPhone</h1>
	<p><img src="/assets/4eefad32dabe9d336000465c/gauges256.png" style="display: inline; float: right; margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;"> We&#8217;re excited to announce the launch of the Gaug.es iPhone App in the App Store! We&#8217;ve been working for a while now to bring Gaug.es to your phone in a native format and its been worth it. The iPhone app will give you a quick overview of all your gauges, and let you see traffic, top content, and top referrers for each gauge. In landscape mode the App will also display your traffic live in AirTraffic. This being my first iPhone App to be a part of there was much learning involved. Saving down every element in 2x for retina display, 1x for older iPhone users and not to mention the slew of icons for the App Store, iPad, iPhone etc.</p>
